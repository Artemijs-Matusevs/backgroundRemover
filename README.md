# backgroundRemover.

A web-application which will remove the background of an uploaded image. Created using Node.js with Express.js and the Background Removal API by ObjectCut: https://objectcut.com/

## To run this application:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make sure Node is installed on the machine.
3. The API keys have been removed from the "index.js" file (const access_token = "";) for Gyazo and ('X-RapidAPI-Key': '',) for ObjectCut. Will need to generate API keys from ObjectCut and Gyazo APIs.
4. Run npm i, within the console inside the project directory, to install all needed node modules
5. Run node index.js, to start a local server on port 3000: http://localhost:3000/
