# backgroundRemover

A web-application which will remove the background of an uploaded image. Created using Node.js with Express.js and the Background Removal API by ObjectCut: https://objectcut.com/

To run this application:

** Fork the repo.
** Make sure Node is installed on the machine.
** The API keys have been removed from the "index.js" file (const access_token = "";) for Gyazo and ('X-RapidAPI-Key': '',) for ObjectCut. Will need to generate API keys from ObjectCut and Gyazo APIs.
** Run npm i, within the console inside the project directory, to install all needed node modules
** Run node index.js, to start a local server on port 3000: http://localhost:3000/
